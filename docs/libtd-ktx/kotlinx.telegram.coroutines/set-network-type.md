# setNetworkType

`suspend fun `[`TelegramFlow`](../kotlinx.telegram.core/-telegram-flow/index.html)`.setNetworkType(type: `[`NetworkType`](https://tdlibx.github.io/td/docs/org/drinkless/td/libcore/telegram/TdApi.NetworkType.html)`?): `[`Unit`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-unit/index.html)

Suspend function, which sets the current network type. Can be called before authorization.
Calling this method forces all network connections to reopen, mitigating the delay in switching
between different networks, so it should be called whenever the network is changed, even if the
network type remains the same. Network type is used to check whether the library can use the network
at all and also for collecting detailed network data usage statistics.

### Parameters

`type` - The new network type. By default, networkTypeOther.
