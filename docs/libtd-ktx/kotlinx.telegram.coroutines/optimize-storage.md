Suspend function, which optimizes storage usage, i.e. deletes some files and returns new storage
usage statistics. Secret thumbnails can't be deleted.

### Parameters

`size` - Limit on the total size of files after deletion. Pass -1 to use the default limit.

`ttl` - Limit on the time that has passed since the last time a file was accessed (or creation
time for some filesystems). Pass -1 to use the default limit.

`count` - Limit on the total count of files after deletion. Pass -1 to use the default limit.

`immunityDelay` - The amount of time after the creation of a file during which it can't be
deleted, in seconds. Pass -1 to use the default value.

`fileTypes` - If not empty, only files with the given type(s) are considered. By default, all
types except thumbnails, profile photos, stickers and wallpapers are deleted.

`chatIds` - If not empty, only files from the given chats are considered. Use 0 as chat
identifier to delete files not belonging to any chat (e.g., profile photos).

`excludeChatIds` - If not empty, files from the given chats are excluded. Use 0 as chat
identifier to exclude all files not belonging to any chat (e.g., profile photos).

`chatLimit` - Same as in getStorageStatistics. Affects only returned statistics.

**Return**
[StorageStatistics](https://tdlibx.github.io/td/docs/org/drinkless/td/libcore/telegram/TdApi.StorageStatistics.html) Contains the exact storage usage statistics split by chats and file
type.
