# addSavedAnimation

`suspend fun `[`TelegramFlow`](../kotlinx.telegram.core/-telegram-flow/index.html)`.addSavedAnimation(animation: `[`InputFile`](https://tdlibx.github.io/td/docs/org/drinkless/td/libcore/telegram/TdApi/InputFile.html)`?): `[`Unit`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-unit/index.html)

animation is added to the beginning of the list. If the animation was already in the list, it is
removed first. Only non-secret video animations with MIME type &amp;quot;video/mp4&amp;quot; can be added to
the list.

### Parameters

`animation` - The animation file to be added. Only animations known to the server (i.e.
successfully sent via a message) can be added to the list.
