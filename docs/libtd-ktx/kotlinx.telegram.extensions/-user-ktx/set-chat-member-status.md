function is currently not suitable for adding new members to the chat and transferring chat
ownership; instead, use addChatMember or transferChatOwnership. The chat member status will not be
changed until it has been synchronized with the server.

### Parameters

`chatId` - Chat identifier.

`status` - The new status of the member in the chat.
